 Just another password generator.


The program generates a password from the dictionary.
In the password, randomly selected words are randomly cut and mixed with numbers.

This password is easier to remember than a similar randomly generated password of the same length.
At the same time it has the same resistance to bruteforce.

Use python 3 to run the jagp.py

The program accepts 2 optional arguments - the length of the password and the number of generated passwords.
